    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <h2>Sir Thomas Howard</h2>
    <h3>Now may I morne</h3>
    <p>
        The poems opening with the speaker mourning the forced seperating emphasized how external pride 
        disrupts their relationships "Now may I morne as one off late / Dryuen by force from y my delyte."
        This highlights the pride either from social expectation or rivalry can lead to emotional suffering
        The speaker rejects wealth and all other concerns making their commitment to love as their source of pride 
        "I wyll not swerue i yow insure / for gold nor yet for worldly fere." This shows how pride can lead to 
        neglecting of reality leading to emotional sacrifices.
    </p>
    <h3>Wyth sorowful syghes and wondes</h3>
    <p>
        The speaker shows great sorrow and pain caused by seperation, showing the emotional distress
        caused by prideful choices that forced the lovers away. "Wyth sorowful syghes and wondes smart / my hart ys persed sodaynly."
        The line shows how prideful action create heartache, leading the speaker to mourn the loss of their lover.
    </p>
    <h3>Who hath more cawse for to complayne</h3>
    <p>
        The Speaker complains that despite both being in love, they cant obtain eachother. 
        Pride from external pressure (eachother) and personal ego obstructs their happiness.
        "Then I wych louys and louyd agayne / yet can not optayne." This line shows the pain caused by 
        prideful ideas, showing a contrasting idea of pride that is to a feel great but causes sorrow.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <h2>Lady Margaret Douglas</h2>
    <h3>I may well say with Ioyfull harte</h3>
    <p>
        The Speakers lover endures pain driven by a commitment to love despite the hardship.
        "great paynes he suffereth for my sake / contynnually both nyght and day." The Lovers pride in their 
        durability, rather than looking for a compromise fuels their own suffering. Refusing to 
        punishments reflects the internal pride the lover has to their commitment driving them to persist
        at their own emotional sacrafice. Pride as the source of suffering. 

    </p>
    <h3>There is no cure ffor care of miyd</h3>
    <p>
        The Speaker knows their fate, showing how their pride leads to meaningless efforts out of 
        their own control "I cannat sayll agayst the wynd / nor help the thyng past remedy." In this sense pride 
        us revealed through the speakers struggle and unwilling to accept their own limits. They understand their circumstances
        are out of their own control however the persistence in caring about it reflect prides role in preventing
        acceptance.
