    <h3>"Blithe was our bearing; often we vowed that but death alone would part us two, Naught else. But this is turned round now ... as if it never were our friendship."
        (The Wife's Lament)</h3>
    <p> This line creates a cycle of the idea that once there was an unbreakable bond that, with time, became something that doesn't even feel like a friendship. The speaker's sense of pride in this bond completely changed; the duality in emotion that the lifetime of that relationship created has left a void, questioning if it was ever real. This shift reflects the vulnerability of placing pride in relationships, as the speakers grief reveals how profoundly the loss of meaning affects self-perception, leaving them grappling with the weight of disillusionment.

    <h3>"He was sad and full of shame, knowing he had lost her."
        (Lanval)
    </h3>

    <p>
        This line creates a cycle of the idea that once there was an unbreakable bond that, with time, became something that doesn't even feel like a friendship. The speaker's sense of pride in this bond completely changed; the duality in emotion that the lifetime of that relationship created has left a void, questioning if it was ever real. This shift reflects the vulnerability of placing pride in relationships, as the speakers grief reveals how profoundly the loss of meaning affects self-perception, leaving them grappling with the weight of disillusionment. It highlights how pride, when intertwined with relationships, can shift from a source of strength to one of painful self-reflection when that bond is broken.

    <h3>"I send my little dripping pen unceasingly over an assemblage of books of great beauty."
        (Pangur Ban)</h3>
    <p>
        This line reflects the sense of pride turning into loss; the speaker's love for knowledge that once fueled his pride begins to feel mechanical and exhausting. The dripping pen suggests a relentless pursuit so much so that they are committed to something that no longer fulfills them. The beauty in the books is still there, as to say the completed work still brings them joy; however, the pride in the process that helped drive to a finished product is mixed with weariness. This shows how the pride has turned to a double-edged sword; the pride can push you towards an extent that no longer fulfills the person, contemplating the initial sacrifice.
