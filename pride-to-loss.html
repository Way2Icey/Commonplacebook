    <h3>"Blithe was our bearing; often we vowed that but death alone would part us two, Naught else. But this is turned round now ... as if it never were our friendship."
        (The Wife's Lament)</h3>
    <p> This line creates a cycle of the idea that once there was an unbreakable bond that, with time, became something that doesn't even feel like a friendship. The speaker's sense of pride in this bond completely changed; the duality in emotion that the lifetime of that relationship created has left a void, questioning if it was ever real. The pride they once had in their loyalty has become a source of pain, highlighting how easily meaningful can feel like a lie when it's gone.
    </p>
    
    <h3>"He was sad and full of shame, knowing he had lost her."
        (Lanval)
    </h3>

    <p>
        Lanval goes from being prideful to completely humiliated, as he has lost the one person he had cared about. Lanval's pride in his relationship is central to his character, and losing her makes him feel like he has lost a piece of himself. He feels shame as his wife was what gave him pride in himself; this leaves him questioning if he was ever worth feeling that way. Showing the pride to loss and the way love can twist to shame when the love is no longer there.
    </p>

    <h3>"I send my little dripping pen unceasingly over an assemblage of books of great beauty."
        (Pangur Ban)</h3>
    <p>
        This line reflects the sense of pride turning into loss; the speaker's love for knowledge that once fueled his pride begins to feel mechanical and exhausting. The dripping pen suggests a relentless pursuit so much so that they are committed to something that no longer fulfills them. The beauty in the books is still there, as to say the completed work still brings them joy; however, the pride in the process that helped drive to a finished product is mixed with weariness. This shows how the pride has turned to a double-edged sword; the pride can push you towards an extent that no longer fulfills the person, contemplating the initial sacrifice.
