    <h3> Marvell, Dialogue Between the Body and Soul
        "The pestilence of love does heat, Or hatred's hidden ulcer eat."</h3>

<p> 
    The line vividly portrays the negative emotions endured by the human spirit. Love is usually being uplifting however being referred to as pestilence burning the body and overwhelming it. Similarly hatred is likened to a hidden ulcer destroying the person from within. These metaphors blatantly describe deep internal struggles that test the endurance. The overall message is allowing a perspective that finds peace within both love and hate, having the courage to endure facing both of these extremes with fortitude. Marvels portrayal here allows one to not shift their perspective but accept their position and live happily in their condition. Broadly it applies to the soul and body contemplating their individual existences and that while they cant understand them their fortitude and security should be based in building happiness where they are not forever questioning why.

<h3> 
    Olaudah Equiano
"God might perhaps have permitted this... shadowed me with the wings of his mercy."
</h3>
<p>
    Olaudah  reflects on the strength he has found while enduring his hardships, allowing his faith in god to give him the strength to change his perspective on his condition. He interpreted his challenges as opportunities for growth, interpreting the challenges god have given him as mercy. The picture “shadowed me with the wings of his mercy” paints evokes protection and care, suggesting that his challenges arent faced alone that he is accompanied by god.through this newfound endurance he is no longer held down by his challenges and allows them to be pieces of a bigger plan for growth. This transition changes his pain it source of hope emphasizing resilience through faith.
