    <!-- First section header -->
    
    <h3> "Blithe was our bearing often we vowed that but death alone would part us two, Naught else. But this is turned round now ... as if it never were our friendship."
        (The Wife's Lament)
    </h3>

    <p>
        This line reflects the profound sadness that accompanies broken relationships. The speaker describes and reflects on the strong positive emotions they once had in the relationship, adding gravity to the sadness of the breakup. This shift from great happiness to a void where something once was portrays the pain that comes from bonds being broken. The contrast between the past joy and present emptiness amplifies the sense of loss, highlighting how the absence of what was once deeply cherished can lead to feelings of grief and longing. The speaker’s contemplation of the relationship’s former warmth deepens the emotional impact of the dissolution, revealing how such bonds, once foundational, leave a lasting ache when they fracture.
    </p>
    <h3>
        "The vain travail hath wearied me so sore, / I am of them that farthest cometh behind."
        (Thomas Wyatt)  
    </h3>
    <p> 
        Thomas conveys the hardship of striving for something and still feeling left behind. "Vain travail" speaks to the effort spent pursuing a goal that seems unattainable and elusive, leaving the speaker weak and unmotivated. This reflection of human emotion highlights the experience of unfulfilled ambition. It's a strong reminder of how human emotions like disappointment can change one's own image of their self-worth. The term "vain" intensifies the sense of futility, suggesting that all the effort put forth has yielded no lasting results. This sense of failure affects not only the speaker’s perception of their achievements but also their personal identity, as the struggle itself erodes their confidence and hope.
