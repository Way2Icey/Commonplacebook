    </div>

    <!-- First section header -->
    
    <h3> "Blithe was our bearing often we vowed that but death alone would part us two, Naught else. But this is turned round now ... as if it never were our friendship."
        (The Wife's Lament)
    </h3>

    <p>
        This line reflects the profound sadness that is accompanied by broken relationships. The speaker describes and reflects on the strong positive emotions they had in the relationship, adding gravity to the sadness of the breakup. This shift from great happiness to void of something that once was portrays the pain from bonds being broken.
    </p>
    <h3>
        "The vain travail hath wearied me so sore, / I am of them that farthest cometh behind."
        (Thomas Wyatt)  
    </h3>
    <p> 
        Thomas conveys the hardship of striving for something and still feeling left behind. "Vain travail" speaks to the effort spent pursuing a goal that seems unnatainable and elusive, leaving the speaker weak and unmotivated. This reflection of human emotion highlights the experience of unfulfilled ambition. It's a strong reminder of how human emotions like disappointment can change one's own image of their self-worth.
