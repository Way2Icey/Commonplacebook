   <h3> 
    "I send my little dripping pen unceasingly over an assemblage of books of great beauty,"
    (Pangur Ban)
   </h3>
   <p>
    The poet's dedication to writing is "unceasingly" and with reverence for the "books of great beauty," suggesting an almost spiritual commitment to learning. A dripping pen can symbolize both the physical labor and emotional commitment that the poet gives to his pursuits. This passion can align with a divine influence in the sense of internal purpose and the pursuit of creation driven by a duty to knowledge. The act of writing, depicted as an ongoing, almost sacred task, reflects a deep, personal devotion that transcends simple artistic expression, positioning the poet as a conduit for higher truths. In this sense, the writerâ€™s work is not just a personal endeavor, but a duty to honor and preserve the wisdom and beauty of the world through his craft.

    "Great paynes he suffereth for my sake / contynnually both nyght and day."
(Lady Margaret Douglas)
</h3>
<p>
    Lady Margaret Douglas describes the immense pain in a very similar and symbolic way, reflecting a sacrifice much like Jesus. This also mirrors religious imagery in the sense that suffering births duty and love for others. Both night and day emphasize the relentlessness of the suffering, creating depth for the divine influences. Douglas sees this sacrifice as not just a human emotion, but as something that evokes spiritual and divine motivation within the story. The continuous nature of suffering, symbolized by the passage of time from night to day, speaks to the transformative power of enduring hardship for a greater cause, elevating the personal sacrifice to a higher, almost divine purpose. Through this lens, the pain is not just an act of endurance but a channel for deeper spiritual connection and purpose.
