    <h2>Malory's Morte Darthur</h2>
    <p>
        The aftermath of the battle shows camelot destroyed, arther and lancelots debate 
        causes unrest among knights " When this was known openly, that king arthur and sir lancelot were 
        at debate, and many were full heavy of their debate" The argument shows the consequences of pride in both 
        sides of the argument leading to divid within the kingdom. King Arthur struggle with the news of 
        news of lancelot taking his wife challengs his pride and forces him to be hesitant to confront the situation
        "For Sir Launcelot is an hardy knight, and all ye know he is the best knight among us all." Arthurs pride 
        in his knight blinds his reality, Betraying someone he deeply values causes the hesitation in his mind.
        Lancelot's determination serves as an example of how pride and the pride his queen has for him, push him to not 
        appear as cowardly. "Fair nephew, said Sir Launcelot, I marvel me much why ye say thus, sithen the queen hath sent for me"
        lancelots pride in his perceived abilities by others causes him to act against reason, showcasing the mirroring between 
        both Arthur and Lancelot's prideful decision making.
