    <h2>Thomas Wyatt</h2>
    <h3>Whoso list to hunt</h3>
    <p>
        Wyatt highlights the consequences of pride through the speakers pursuit of a woman 
        symbolized by a hind. His pride blinds him to thinking he can, causing him to become frustrated.
        "The vain travail hath wearied me so sore, / I am of them that farthest cometh behind." Knowing hes 
        exhausted, his pride doesnt allow him to stop. Pursuing leads him nowhere, showing how pride can trap someone
        to an endless drive.
    </p>
    <h3>They flee from me</h3>
    <p>
        The speaker reminisces on his lover, "But once in special, / In thin array after a pleasant guise...
         / And softly said, 'Dear heart, how like you this" This moment shows his pride in believing the affection
         will last. However "all is turned through my gentleness / Into a strange fashion of forsaking" his realization 
         shows the pain from the pride. His belief blinded him to the reality leaving him betrayed knowing his partner is
         seeking out other lovers.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <h2>Henry Howard</h2>
    <h3>In Ciprus, springes</h3>
    <p>
        The speaker contrasts passionate fire and cold rejections, "Endless despair long thralldom hath imprest."
       illustrating the speaker's once free heart now caged. The reminiscing is evident of the pride they once had in their 
       passionate love holds dear and continuing to care causes emotional torment. The prideful commitment allows the 
       endless suffering.
    </p>
    <h3>Set me wheras</h3>
    <p>
        The speaker paints an example of the polarity that they are willing to endure continuing their devotion. 
        "Yours will I be and with that only thought, comfort myself when that my hap is naught."
        In different circumstances, the speaker's pride keeps them loyal and is a source of comfort for the speaker. 
        Confident in their ability to stay committed while enduring any hardship or emotional suffering. Pride
        serves as an anchor in their unwavering commitment.
