    <h2>Lanval</h2>
    <p>
        Pride is central to the narrative in lanval, the beginning of the story shows lanval isolating himself
        due to his pride. His status as a knight and his sense of abandonment by arthur, he feels excluded. "The king forgot this man;
        none put in a good word for him." Lanval expects more as a knight of the round table but is met with 
        no recognition leaving his pride unfilled. The ability for Laval to keep his condition with the fairy a secret is a testament
        to his pride. Lanval being tried for offending the queen and violating his oath shows the downfall and destructiveness 
        of his pride. “He was sad and full of shame, knowing he had lost her.” This contrasts sharpley the arrogance his pride gave him when he was unrecognized by the round table, with the humility
        he has to endure of keeping the fairy a secret. The pride turned to humility which then turned to redemption when the fairy lover saves him.
