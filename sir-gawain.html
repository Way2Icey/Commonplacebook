    <h2>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</h2>
    <p>
     Gawains pride in his role as a knight of the roundtable comples him to step to the challenge of the 
     green knight. "I am the weakest, i know, and the feeblest of spirit, And the loss of my life 
     would be least of any; That i have you for my uncle is my only praise." Gawains words reflect both humility
     and pride, he feels unworthy to the other knightws but masks it in the pursuit to prove himself.
     As Gawain approaches his encounter with the Green Knight, his pride in his bravery and honor is tested. When the |
     Lady Bertilak offers him the girdle his pride is tested, When its revealed he took the girdle Gawain feels the shame.
     "This is the blazon of the blemish that I bear on my neck; This is the sign of sore loss that I have suffered there
     For the cowardice and coveting that seized me there." Gawains confession shows his realization, that pride for his survival
     caused him to fail the true test of his knighthood, the inital pursuit and last consequence of his prideful actions.
     Gawains pride is the reason he takes on the quest, however it is the very same reason he fails the quest.
     showing the double edged sword that is a prideful action and mindset.
