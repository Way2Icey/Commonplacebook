    <h3> Paradise Lost
        "All is not lost; the unconquerable Will, And study of revenge, immortal hate, And courage never to submit or yield."</h3>

<p> 
    This quote displays the hope within adversity through the resilience and determination of the human spirit. The “unconquerable will” represents the extent to which humans will go to maintain their hope despite overwhelming pressure.  Specifically, it highlights a denial of submission no matter the odds. In a broader context is reflects the defiance satan after he was cast into hell, showing hope can reinterpreted as resolve even in darker minds. The quote further suggests that hope and determination are inseparable, a unity forged to endure hardship.

<h3> 
    Olaudah Equiano
"Trials and disappointments are sometimes for our good... God might perhaps have permitted this in order to teach me wisdom and resignation."
</h3>
<p>
    Olaudahs reflection connects his hope to his faith during a struggling time to help him understand his trials. He further develops this understanding by correlating these trials as a position to grow and learn that god has imposed onto him for his sake. The acknowledgment as benefits reframes his position of suffering and allows for a perspective where hardships are appreciated for his growth potential. This frame of mind introduces the idea that hope can arise from trust in a higher purpose, even when tested through pain, Olaudah’s faith anchors his hope enabling him to see god as guiding him through a process. The quote Displays hope in adversity as a force that translates pain into resilience and opportunity.
