    <h2>Pangur Ban</h2>
    <p>
        Both the speaker and Pangur exhibit pride in their work. The Pride of the scholar
        is that of intellectual pursuit, this pride isnt arrogant but a personal representation of his 
        self worth derived from his mastery. "I love (it is better than all fame) to be quiet beside My
        book, diligently pursuing knowledge." This suggests the speakers pride comes from learning itself,
        not from any external validation. Pride in knowledge for its own sake. The scholars pride is 
        solitary, indictive of a rejection of fame for personal fullfillment.
        Pangur mirrors this concept of pride in a more childish form. "White Pangur does not envy me:
        he loves his childish craft." Pangurs pride in hunting is much like the scholars, it is uncompetitive. 
        The cats intentions are simple by nature, he acts this way based on his own personal contentment. 
        This complimentry relationship between the scholar and Pangur offer a theme of pride that when removed
        from competition and comparison is harmonious.

    <h2>My hand is weary with writing</h2>
    <p>
        The speaker has pride in the transmission of knowledge, The text can suggest that the writer
        feels they are serving a higher purpose providing the world with knowledge. The line "A Steady
        stream of wisdom springs from my well-colored neat fair hand; on the page it pours its draft of ink of the Green
        -skinned holly." We can gather the idea of knowledge flowing from the pen as something very important, so much so 
        like water from a spring. While the speaker is proud of their work, the repeated refrences to weariness|
        suggests consequences of this pride. This is emphasized by the opening and closing lines of the text,"My hand is weary with writing"
        "Whence my hand is weary with writing." This weariness can be seen as a consequence of the writers dedication, 
        that the pursuit of providing their knowledge comes at a cost, physical exhaustion. This can bring the perspective of exhaustion being 
        a sort of evidence or badge of honor showing the writers commitment to providing this knowledge. This idea is even further reinforced by
        the quote "I send my little dripping pen unceasingly over an assemblage of books of great beauty,"
        the speaker is adamant about their determination with the term "unceasingly" as to describe their working effort, prideful nature of their work and 
        unbotherd nature regarding the physical consequences of ther devotion.
