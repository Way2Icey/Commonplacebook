  <h3> 
    "Yours will I be and with that only thought, comfort myself when that my hap is naught."
(Set me wheras)
  </h3>
 <p>
    The speakers devotion is stated; they find comfort in belonging to someone else; through this exclamation of desire, they are showing vulnerability and acting on their own realization. This line is born of self-acceptance and desire; the speaker, content with their own desires, accepts being vulnerable in pursuit of his devotion. </p>
<h3>
    "Endless despair long thralldom hath imprest."(Henry Howard)
 </h3>
 <p>
    Howards line is undertoned with a sense of submission to one circumstance; since they feel their own condition is inescapable, they have come to accept their own fate, and in the acknowledgment of that, they are vulnerable to their own self-image. Through their acceptance of the condition, they don't deny the "endless despair" it brings. This acknowledgment is slightly empowering. Although they feel they're destined for disparity, their acceptances allow for any vulnerability to be washed away. This kind of humility requires inner strength, finding peace in unavoidable hardship.
