    <h3> "I am the weakest, I know, and the feeblest of spirit, And the loss of my life would be least of any; That I have you for my uncle is my only praise."
        (Sir Gawain and the Green Knight)</h3>

  <p> Gawains self-humiliation in this line conveys that by diminishing his own worth, going so far as to say his own death would mean little. This moment reflects how Gawain feels about himself in a local context of the current scenario and on a grand scale, as in a knight of the roundtable. This absolute self-humiliation shows the correlation Gawain connects between his own success and his own self-worth. This also adds depth to the internal conflict Gawain fights being the nephew of Arthur, seemingly feeling that he falls short of all expectations.

<h3> 
    "This is the blazon of the blemish that I bear on my neck; This is the sign of sore loss that I have suffered there For the cowardice and coveting that seized me there."(Sir Gawain and the Green Knight)  
</h3>
<p>
    Here Gawain recognizes a both symbolic and physical blemish on his neck that shows his failure in the Green Knights test. The line shows admission of his own shame and weakness; humiliation in this context takes a two-part role in both personal failure for Gawain and also a public example of failure by the green knight and everyone else who knows of his mistakes.
