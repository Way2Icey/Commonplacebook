    <h3> Paradise Lost
        "That Glory never shall his wrath or might extort from me."
        </h3>

<p> 
    In paradise lost, the words display a powerful declaration of defiance and the courage to challenge the standard. They reflect a strong determination to resist oppression and establish personal autonomy, even in adversity. The passage encourages readers to embrace transform and rebel against any force that suppress their autonomy and freedom. It frames change as courageous choice and not just a passive development. With the broader context of this quote being satan and this being a complex portrayal as satan a tragic and defiant figure. Someone who embraces change even when destructive such as in satans case, transforming his suffering into resolve.

<h3> 
    Peacham, Minerva Britanna
"In little time, our sloth corrupteth it... foul and stinking ill."
</h3>
<p>
    Peachams words draw conclusion based on the decay that arises from complacency. Illustrating how being stagnant can lead to moral degradation, the sloth giving rise to stinking ill shows the base of the quote. When your doing less you are less. The courage to change is present as a remedy in this passage, individuals must confront their own habits and take steps towards growth and renewal as to avoid corruption. Change here is not just aspiration but safety from pitfalls of being sloth and to preserve the quality of your life. This quote emphasizes the ambition needed to overcome our own limits and embrace self-imporvement.
