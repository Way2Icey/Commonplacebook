    <h3> "For Sir Launcelot is an hardy knight, and all ye know he is the best knight among us all."
        (Malory's Morte Darthur)</h3>

    <p>This line blatantly describes how Launcelot is shaped by his own public identity and recognition of others.Launcelot's skill as the best knight suggests he takes pride in his own abilities; the pride is then reinforced.through the acknowledgment of his fellow knights. This is a layered form of pride that is tied to both personal prowess andexternal validation. This perspective of self and socially validating pride assumes pride is a social construct. Being shapedby the validation and affimations of the community, allowing for both public pride and personal pride to exist with each other.

    <h3>"I am the weakest, I know, and the feeblest of spirit, And the loss of my life would be least of any; That I have you for my uncle is my only praise."
        (Sir Gawain and the Green Knight) 
    </h3>
    <p> In this line from Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Gawains humility shows pride in his fellow knights.
        and his King, Arthur. Gawain downplays his own self-worth to allow for pride in the roundtable. In his suggestion
        to self-sacrifice as a way to protect Arthur and his court. Gawain expresses this pride in his relation to
        someone or a group of people he knew as great or more worthy.
    </p>

    <h3>
        "Great paynes he suffereth for my sake / contynnually both nyght and day."
        (Lady Margaret Douglas)
    </h3>

    <p>
        Lady Margaret Douglas expresses the deep pride of a loved one's sacrifices, acknowledging and admiring
        their endurance and commitment. Highlighting the great pain endured for her sake, Douglas emphasizes the value of loyalty and selflessness in their relationship.
        The pride arises from the recognition of another's devotion. Her appreciation for these sacrifices demonstrates a connection as well as a moral heightening of the person making the sacrifice.
        The pride is then intertwined with gratitude; showing pride in others can be a reflection of respect and love.
