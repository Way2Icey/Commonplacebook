    <h3> "For Sir Launcelot is an hardy knight, and all ye know he is the best knight among us all."
        (Malory's Morte Darthur)</h3>

    <p>This line blatantly describes how Launcelot is shaped by his own public identity and the recognition of others. Launcelot's skill as the best knight suggests he takes pride in his own abilities; the pride is then reinforced through the acknowledgment of his fellow knights. This is a layered form of pride that is tied to both personal prowess and external validation. This perspective of self and socially validating pride assumes pride is a social construct, shaped by the expectations and affirmations of the community. It underscores how public pride and personal pride coexist, each amplifying and reinforcing the other in a dynamic interplay.

    <h3>"I am the weakest, I know, and the feeblest of spirit, And the loss of my life would be least of any; That I have you for my uncle is my only praise."
        (Sir Gawain and the Green Knight) 
    </h3>
    <p> In this line from Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Gawains humility shows pride in his fellow knights and his King, Arthur. Gawain downplays his own self-worth to allow for pride in the Round Table. By suggesting self-sacrifice as a way to protect Arthur and his court, Gawain expresses pride rooted in loyalty and collective identity. This form of pride transcends personal achievement, as Gawain finds value in serving and preserving the reputation of those he admires. It reflects a communal pride, where ones worth is measured through their connection to and defense of a greater ideal or legacy.

    <h3>
        "Great paynes he suffereth for my sake / contynnually both nyght and day."
        (Lady Margaret Douglas)
    </h3>

    <p>
        Lady Margaret Douglas expresses the profound pride inspired by a loved one’s sacrifices, acknowledging and admiring their endurance and commitment. Highlighting the great pain endured for her sake, Douglas emphasizes the value of loyalty and selflessness in their relationship. The pride arises from the recognition of another's devotion, elevating their moral stature in her eyes. This pride, intertwined with gratitude, demonstrates how admiration for another’s actions deepens emotional bonds. It suggests that pride in others is not merely an appreciation of their deeds but also a reflection of respect, love, and the shared strength of a meaningful connection.
