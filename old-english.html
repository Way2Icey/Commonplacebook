    <h2>CÃ¦dmon's Story and Hymn</h2>
    <p>
        In Caedmons hymn there is an obvious expression of pride in creation and god. There is a 
        repeating emphasis on God's creation establishes him as having an intellect worthy of praise "now
        we must praise heaven-kingdoms guardian, measurers might and his mind plans," This invokes an idea 
        that God's mind is beyond comprehension, This is justified pride in Gods All knowing mind. 
        the attribution of all creation to god suggest true pride doesnt come from personal achievements 
        but by the realization of the source of all power and creation.

    <h2>The Wanderer</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout the passage the wanderer expresses pride in his ability to take on hardships
        without showing emotional weakness. This is reflected in this passage "For any eorl an excellent virtue
        is to lock tight the treasure chest within ones heart, howsoever may he think." The treasure chest is a metaphor
        for the Emotions hes holding which he believes to be virtuous. The wanderer is submitting to cultural 
        codes of manhood that value innver strength and control above everything. The consequences for this pride
        is loneliness, emotion and vulnerability are sacrificed for maintaing control. The wanderer knows this
        "Fate is firmly set." He acknowledges that under his conditions his fate is inescapable, 
        The wanderers pride in his control is from locking away his emotion, his emotions from losing his kinsmen 
        and his homeland. He cant avoid these realizations but he can control his emotions for them. 
        The relationship between his loss and isolation with the pride and control fuel eachother, a necessary means
        to an unavoidable fate of suffering.

    <h2>The Wife's Lament</h2>
    <p>
       A central theme of this poem is the speakers pride in her relationship with her lord. 
       The love being strong and fruitful as seen when she reflects on the promises made to eachother.
       "Blithe was our bearing often we vowed that but death alone would part us two,
       Naught else. But this is turned round now ... as if it never were our friendship."
       The speaker takes pride in the bond once had, however the tragedey of the poem is the 
       vows were broken. The consequences of this pride are devastating, the bond has been disintegrated, 
       she is left alone filled with longing and grief.
