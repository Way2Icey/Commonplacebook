    <h3> Paradise Lost 
        “Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven” (1.263)
        “Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven” (1.263)
        “adamantine chains and penal fire” (1.48)
        “Farewell happy fields, / Where joy forever dwells: hail horrors, hail / Infernal world” (1.249-251)
        </h3>

<p> 
    In Book One of Paradise Lost, Milton describes the justification of a rebellion through Satan's speeches. These speeches persuade the moral gray areas of asserting autonomy. “Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven” (1.263), the line explains the rejection Satan has for the hierarchies within heaven and portrays his rebellion as a textbook form of freedom one can achieve even if it's at one’s cost. Satan justifies this assertion because his mind has its own sovereignty and can change its perspective of where it is. “The mind is its own place, and in itself/ Can make a heaven of Hell or a Hell of Heaven.” (1.254-255) These words reflect the mindful connection Satan has made with his rebellious acts and position Satan as someone who finds it empowering to be rebellious, as it is in the mind's true nature. 
However, Milton complicates his own portrayal in the revelations of Satan's consequences. While Satan believes his rebellious activities are a good thing, the conditions of hell contrast these ideals. Hell is described with Satan in “adamantine chains and penal fire(1.48), displaying suffering as a result of Satan's ambition. This contrast calls into question Satan's reasoning for his autonomy, whether it's truly self-rule or rooted in pride. Satan acknowledges the costs of his actions when he states, Farewell, happy fields,/where joy forever dwells: hail horrors/inferno world” (1.249-251). This reflection shows he understands he's lost something good and gained something bad. Milton later frames Satan's actions as though logical, ultimately defying a higher immutable truth, the “eternal justice" (1.209). While the bulk of Satan's justification is sound, it blatantly acknowledges wrongs to accompany you. Even though you're justified in creating a world with your autonomy, it is at the cost of divine harmony.
