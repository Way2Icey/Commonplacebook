    <h3> 1747, Collins, Ode to Evening
        "While spring shall pour his showrs... Shall fancy, Friendship, science, smiling peace, the gentlest influence own."
        </h3>

<p> 
    This quote from Collins reflects hope in renewal by displaying nature's cyclical system. Spring has its showers become a metaphor for nurturing life and symbolizing the continuous opportunity for growth. Friendship, science, and smiling peace as elements that thrive in these points of renewal in the sense human connections, intellectual pursuits, and peaceful living are revitalized by the forces of nature in the spring. The quote suggests that the softness in the renewal not only restores what may have been lost but can habilitate creativity and harmony developing optimistic outlooks even post times of hardship and despair. Within this context, the whole quote is a reflection of hope in a process that gives renewal and the cycle itself inquires about hope within times of despair.

<h3> 
    Peacham, Minerva Britanna "If we do not exercise our wit by daily labour and invention still... our sloth corrupteth it."
</h3>
<p>
    Peacham's declaration connects renewal to the active development of one's intellect and creative outlook. The statement warns against the decline in development and growth of negative traits that accompany idleness. In turn, consistency is essential in maintaining a developing and healthy mind. Framing labor as a form of renewal, Peacham shows the power of persistence when overcoming stagnating times. This emphasis on invention shows that hope in a renewal lies in an individual's ability to utilize his inner resources shaping their character by active pursuits. It displays praise for humans as a source of continuous development and allows for a new outlook giving passion for the idea of constant effort and growth.
