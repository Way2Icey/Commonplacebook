    <h3>
        Humility in Self
"My hand is weary with writing." (Pangur Ban)
    </h3>
<p>
    The speaker's physical limitations encapsulate his humility. The writer pursues knowledge through a labor-intensive means; this line is a declaration of devotion through their own physical sacrifices. The humilation in the acknowledgement of a physical hardship during the pursuit of knowledge gives weight to the devotion to the craft and pursuit that the writer holds. This moment of self-reflection shows ambition doesn't allow for endless energy and that even the most passionate pursuits enlist humility to accept physical boundries.
</p>

<h3>
    Then I wych louys and louyd agayne / yet can not optayne."
    (Who hath more cawse for to complayne)
</h3>
<p>
    This line shows a form of self-humility in the form of unfulfilled love. The speaker gives love and gets it in return, but it does not satisfy him. Unable to attain what they want, the humility about realizing their reciprocated feelings still left them unfulfilled. There is a form of acceptance in this line, that even though he gave and got, he was still not met with happiness. The speakers admission to this shows maturity and acceptance in the circumstances.
